# Prestige Worldwide - Bylaws

Welcome! This is the general setup and bylaws for the Prestige Worldwide League. Please remember if you have any questions contact Jason or Joe for clarification.

## Owner Expectations

Owners are expected to:
- Read and be familiar with the scoring, rules, and bylaws.
- Adhere to the rules and bylaws listed below.
- Have internet access.
- Login to the site frequently during the regular season AND off season to conduct league business.
- Maintain a valid e-mail address, and keep it updated on Sleeper.
- Work towards winning championships and keeping your team competitive.
- Participate in the processes of the league in a timely manner including but not limited to voting in league polls, activity in the chat, respond to trade requests, lineup submissions, etc...

This league will not be held hostage by inactive managers. I intend to run an active and fun league and team owners who do not abide by the above expectations will be considered for termination.

## Keystroke Error Clause

Mistakes that occur due to human/software error will be corrected so long as the mistake is stated on the chat and reported to the commissioner immediately after the mistake is made or within a reasonable amount of time thereafter. This league is managed using software and devices that can make facilitating an add/drop and other features tricky. This is a dynasty league. I will not hold managers accountable for understandable mistakes that may affect them for years to come. We’re all grownups here.

## Rule Changes and League Amendments

League polls, votes, messages, and discussions regarding rules and league structure will be available for a reasonable amount of time. As a commissioner, I give ample notifications and reminders when they are posted. If you miss the opportunity to engage in this process of the league, it is no one&#39;s fault but your own. If you have a question regarding this, please re-read the above expectations.

Any manager proposed changes to the league format or scoring must be posted to the message board for league input or posted as a poll/group chat. Changes will require a majority vote, of those who participate, to be implemented. League commissioners retain the right to veto proposed rule changes and implement changes to the league without a vote to maintain the integrity and support my vision for its future. All rule changes proposed in season will not be implemented until the beginning of the following season. In season rule changes will require all managers approval.

## Commissioner/Co-Commissioner

The league will have both a commissioner (Jason) and co-commissioner (Joe). I will be discussing all important league business with Joe before changes or decisions are made. The commish and co-commish will be responsible for implementing the procedures of the league, collecting fees, and any other day to day league processes such as implementing polls and messages regarding proposed rule changes.

## Commissioner Clause

Should issues, problems, or circumstances arise for which a remedy is not stated in the rules, the commissioner reserves the right take whatever actions he deems necessary to protect the integrity and best interest of the league.

## System Error Clause

If there is an error with some process of the league that is stated in the bylaws, owners have 24 hours to notify the commissioner, so the issue can be addressed and resolved as quickly as possible. Rules as stated in the bylaws will ALWAYS override the result of the error.

## Rosters

The league will be comprised of 12 teams. Active rosters will consist of a maximum of 30 players regardless of position throughout the season and up to 35 during the off season starting in 2025. By the cut down deadline your active roster must be trimmed to 30 players again.

## Cut down

Prior to each year’s opening game, teams must cut their rosters back down to 30 players on their active roster. The cut down date will be determined and posted to the calendar each season prior to the first NFL regular season game.

## Lineups

Starting lineups may not include bye week players. Active management of starting lineups is expected. Neglected lineups will not be tolerated. Penalties for frequently neglected lineups could include loss of future rookie draft picks. Starting lineups will consist of the following:

Starting Lineup (10 starters):
- 1-QB
- 2-RB
- 3-WR
- 1-TE
- 2-Flex(WR/TE/RB)
- 1-SF(QB/WR/TE/RB)

## Inactive Penalty

If an owner is starting an inactive, injured, or a player widely assumed to underperform while also having available or better players on the roster the owner may receive a warning for the first offence. Any following or subsequent violations will receive consideration for loss of draft picks up to and including a 1st round pick or removal from the league.

## Trades

Trading is allowed and encouraged. There will be no trade deadline. All trades are finalized by the commissioner but will not go through a veto process. All trades will be allowed unless they are assumed to be collusion. Future draft picks will be available for trade up to 2 years out. Draft picks may be traded away or traded for as each owner sees fit. Teams may enter the draft with as many as they can acquire, or as few as they choose. “Conditional” picks, player rental trades, or trades for items of real world value, or future considerations are not allowed. Teams who wish to trade future first round draft picks will be charged a non-refundable fee that goes towards the traded pick year’s dues depending on the pick traded.

Future costs are as follows:
- 1st - $75

## Adds/Drops/Waivers/Free Agency

Free agency will operate as follows:
This league will be utilizing a F.A.A.B. (Free Agency Acquisition Budget) system for waiver wire acquisitions during the league off-season.
Before each season teams will be given a one time $1000 budget to bid on free agents.
Bidding windows will run weekly on Thursdays at 8 am Central time. The highest bidders for an individual player will be awarded the player at the closing of the bidding window and the bidding dollars will be removed from their budget.
Currency will not carry over year to year, but MAY be traded. Once waivers clear, all players will be on a first come first served basis including dropped players.

## Injured Reserve

Injured Reserve consists of 5 spots for injured players only. A player is only eligible to be placed on IR if they are listed as such or on the COVID exempt list. IR Players will not count against the 30-player roster. Once a player is removed from IR by Sleeper, the team manager MUST add that player to their active roster. Active rosters can NEVER EXCEED 30.

## Official Scoring:

Matchups will be a single ‘head to head” game each week along with a second matchup against the league median. Teams that score higher than the league median earn a win, and the others get a loss. Note that all scores are final as of the start of the first game of the following week. Owners are responsible for verifying the scores and the legality of their own lineups. Owners are responsible for notifying the commissioner of stat changes or possible mistakes should they occur. Scoring will be in a decimal format to help eliminate ties.

## Ties

Ties will be counted as just that, a tie.

## Playoff Format

6 team playoff structure. Playoff bracket will consist of the top 6 teams with the best record. Seeding tiebreakers will be in order: overall record, total regular season points scored, head to head results. Playoffs are weeks 15-17. The playoff results will determine the rookie draft order of the playoff teams. The remaining non-playoff team’s rookie picks will be decided by the team’s Potential Points. The team with the lowest potential points in the regular season will receive rookie pick 1.01. This is done to prevent tanking.

## Rookie Draft

The rookie drafts will be 4 rounds of non-snaking NFL style drafts and consist of the incoming rookie class only. Veterans will not be eligible to be acquired through the draft process. Rookie draft order will be decided by the reverse order of standings from the prior season for the bottom 6 teams and for the first two losers of the first round of the playoffs. The championship bracket playoff results for the top 6 will determine their rookie pick order. These drafts will take place by way of email draft with a 24 hour clock. Pick and player trading is allowed and encouraged during all drafts.

## League Dues and Payouts

League dues will be $75 per team. League dues will be due at the conclusion of each fantasy season. The payouts are as follows:
- 1st Place - $500
- 2nd Place - $250
- 3rd Place - $150

## Misc.

Collusion and unsportsmanlike play will NOT BE TOLERATED! League integrity is of the utmost importance as this is a year to year league. The commissioner has the right to intervene under any questionable circumstances. You MUST remain an active team manager regardless of your win loss record. Your moves should be made with the intention of bettering your team for the present or future years while upholding league integrity. Good luck!
