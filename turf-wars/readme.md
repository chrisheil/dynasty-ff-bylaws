IF A TEAM IS ABANDONED: The abandoning owner's 25.00 advance on the following years league fees will be lost to the league and used as a discount measure for a new owner to take over the abandoned team. 

Should an owner leave the league with notice, only the commisioner will be allowed to choose the new replacement owner, however recommendations from other league members or the departing member are encouraged. Part, or all of the advanced fees may be kept for a new owner discount. Part, or all of the advanced fees may be kept as a discount to a new owner in the event that the exiting owner has traded away future draft picks. If a team is left in good standing, with most of it's draft picks, then the owner leaving will receive back their $25 advancement fee. This will be a judegemnt decision made by the commisioner. 

In the event that the Turf Ward FFL should dissolve due to the majority of the league no longer being interested in contuining. The 300.00 remaining in the leagues LeagueSafe account, shall be refunded to all owners equally.

 

INJURED RESERVE

There are 2 spots available for IR. A player must be designated by MFL as being placed on IR by his NFL franchise. All IR players must be either released or returned to their fantasy rosters before the folowing season's rookie draft. Once a player is activated off of the IR by his NFL team or released outright by his NFL team, the player must be removed off of injured reserve by his owner. Failure to do this repeadetely may result in removal from league. Players listed as "out" are not eligible for injured reserve, they must be placed on IR by their NFL team


WAIVERS

In Season Waivers:
Waivers will start up after the inaugrual draft and will be processed on Wednesday at noon during the season. Waivers will be determined by Blind Bidding. The owner that wins the bid gets the player. Players not bid on during the bidding period will move to the free agent pool and be available to each team on a first come, first served basis. There will be a $200 blind bid budget used during the season, minimal bids of $0 are allowed. Blind budget money is non-transferable from regular season to off-season. 

 

Off Season Waivers:

During the off-season, waivers will be closed after week 17 has been completed until the completion of our rookie draft. Off-season waivers will be determined by a league vote, usually once or twice during the off-season, but not before July.  The $200 blind bid budget applies for the entire season (both off season and in season)

 

TRADES

All trades accepted will go through without review unless collusion is suspected by the commisioner or a league member, or if any other league bylaws are broken. The commissioner cannot un-do trades in any other scenario. If a mistake is made during a trade it is up to the involved owners to "re-trade" back the original player, picks, BB money, and make the trade again. It is the owners reponsibililty to double check all offers made. Trades can be accepted during games. It is recommended that you cancel all trade offers before kick off to avoid player injuries changing trade values. 

Trades are permitted until start of week 12 games. Trades can include players and/or draft picks & BB money. Rookie Draft Picks can be traded for up to one year in advance only. 

After the comletion of week 16, trades will be allowed again. Trading will also be allowed during both the inaugural draft and all future rookie drafts.

SCHEDULE & PLAYOFFS

We will have a 14 week regular season with a randomized schedule. Each team will play every other team at least once. Playoffs start during week 15.  The top 6 teams will make the playoffs. #â€™s 1 & 2 Playoff Seeds get a bye in week 1 of the playoffs. There will be re-seeding in the playoff bracket. The highest remianing seed in the playoff bracket will always play the lowest remaining seed in the playoff bracket. Both the championship game and 3rd place game will take place during week 17.  Week 18 will not be relevant.

In the event of a playoff tie, the higher seed will be rewarded the win.


OWNER ETHICS

Any owner(s) determined to be cheating will immediately forfeit ownership of their team and all other rights of ownership, including prize money and deposits already paid to the league. Collaborations between any two or more teams working together to improve one team unfairly will not be tolerated. If it is shown by their actions (Examples: a series of unequal trades, not starting a proper lineup or their best line up to help someone else win). Cheating is any action that helps give your team or another team an unfair advantage and would not be considered by a person of integrity to be honest and in good sportsmanship. It will not be tolerated and you will lose your team and any monies you have vested at the time. No exceptions will be made.

Onwers are expected to run their franchises in a professional manner throughout the entirety of the fantasy season. In other words, pay attention to the ENTIRE season and put your best lineup in each week, even if you are not "playing for anything" during the final weeks of the season. Always play to win. Tanking will also not be tolerated. Trading older picks for draft picks and younger players is perfectly acceptable, however if the majority of the league believes that an owner isn't starting his best players in order to tank for a higher draft pick then the commisioner reserves the right to make a judgement call on the accused owner's future in the league. 

Harassment from owners will not be tolerated. Trash talking, playful namecalling etc is always enouraged, but anything personal will not not be tolerated. If issues persist after multiple warnings, it may result in removal from the league. 

 

The commissioner is not responsible for any problem or technical malfunction, which impedes or interferes with the transmission or receipt of any team transaction, including but not limited to starting lineup submissions. If for some reason there is a down time experienced with our web host, all principle owners can submit an email to the league commissioner reporting the lapse and submit any information pertaining to free agent moves, and starting lineup submissions. These emails are time stamped and will be forwarded to all league member which eliminates the possibililty of collusion. Once the experienced down time has been repaired, the league commissioner will update all information pertaining to starting lineups and free agent acquisitions. 

 

DRAFTS

Inaugral Draft

Our initial startup draft will take place 24 hours after the everyone has paid their league dues, and the draft order has been established. This will be a slow draft with a 24 hour clock per pick. The NFL's 2017 rookie class will be apart of the inaugural draft menaing there will be no sperate rookie draft in 2017. Trades can take place during the draft, 2018 rookie draft picks can also be traded during the draft. All trades will go through immedaitely, but may be reversed if collusion is suspected/proven. If draft picks are made after a trade has to be reversed, the draft will be reverted back if need be. This will be a judgement call made by the commisioner. If the draft clock expires, the next pick will be on the clock and the draft will move on. It is up to the owner who missed his pick to announce his makeup draft pick asap. If an owner fails to make draft picks in time on multiple occasions, the owner may be removed from the league. There will be more leeway on the this during the last 2-3 rounds of the draft.

 

Rookie Draft

2018 will be our league 1st rookie draft, it will take place somewhere between 1-2 weeks after the completion of the NFL draft. The commisoner will announce a draft date at least 14 days in advance. There will be a 24 hour clock to make draft picks. Once the rookie draft date is announced, the following year's rookie rookie draft picks will be officially eligible to be traded. Example: Once the 2018 rookie draft date is announced by the commisioner, 2019 rookie draft picks will be added to the player pool and can be traded. Owners must pay their upcoming season's league fees fully before trading away the newly added draft picks and before the beginning of the rookie draft. If this has not been done, the trade will be reversed and will be have to be re-completed once the fees have been paid. An owner who fails to pay their league dues before the start of the rookie draft is subject to immediate removal from the league.


RULE CHANGES

A proposed rule change needs to pass by a simple majority of 7 votes. Rule changes may be proposed at any time but will not be changed until the next offseason, at the most appropriate time as determined by the commisioner. Once a rule change vote passes, the commisioner will announce when the rule change will take place. Most rule change votes will take place before the rookie draft. 

 

***Players not in the MFL database will not be added to the database by the commissioner, they will only be made available if/when MFL recognizes them as a NFL player***
