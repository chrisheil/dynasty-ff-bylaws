Welcome! This is the general setup and bylaws for Horseshoes and Handgrenades League. Please remember, if you have any questions contact Jason or Chris for clarification.

 

Owner Expectations

Owners are expected to:

    Read and be familiar with the scoring, rules, and bylaws.
    Adhere to the rules and bylaws listed below.
    Have internet access.
    Login to the site frequently during the regular season AND off season to conduct league business.
    Maintain a valid e-mail address, and keep it updated on this site. 
    Work towards winning championships and keeping your team competitive. No tanking allowed.  If owners are believed to be tanking there will be a vote and a possible loss of 1st round draft pick.
    Participate in the processes of the league in a timely manner including but not limited to voting in league polls, activity on the message board, response to trade requests, lineup submissions, etc...
    Join our Groupme group for day to day league and football chat. Vital information will always be posted on the league site.

This league will not be held hostage by inactive managers. I intend to run an active and fun league and team owners who do not abide by the above expectations will be considered for termination.

Keystroke Error Clause

Mistakes that occur due to human/software error will be corrected so long as the mistake is stated on the message board and reported to the commissioner immediately after the mistake is made or within a reasonable amount of time thereafter. This league is managed using software and devices that can make facilitating an add/drop and other features tricky. This is a dynasty league. I will not hold managers accountable for understandable mistakes that may affect them for years to come. We’re all grownups here.

Rule Changes and League Amendments

League polls, votes, messages, and discussions regarding rules and league structure will be available for a reasonable amount of time. As a commissioner, I give ample notifications and reminders when they are posted. If you miss the opportunity to engage in this process of the league, it is no one's fault but your own. If you have a question regarding this, please re-read the above expectations.

Any manager proposed changes to the league format or scoring must be posted to the message board for league input or posted as a poll/group chat. Changes will require a majority vote, of those who participate, to be implemented. League commissioners retain the right to veto proposed rule changes and implement changes to the league without a vote to maintain the integrity and support my vision for its future. All rule changes proposed in season will not be implemented until the beginning of the following season. In season rule changes will require all managers approval.

Commissioner/Co-Commissioner

The league will have both a commissioner (Jason) and co-commissioner (Chris). I will be discussing all important league business with Chris before changes or decisions are made. The commish and co-commish will be responsible for implementing the procedures of the league, collecting fees, and any other day to day league processes such as implementing polls and messages regarding proposed rule changes.

Commissioner Clause

Should issues, problems, or circumstances arise for which a remedy is not stated in the rules, the commissioner reserves the right take whatever actions he deems necessary to protect the integrity and best interest of the league.

System Error Clause
If there is an error with some process of the league that is stated in the bylaws, owners have 24 hours to notify the commissioner, so the issue can be addressed and resolved as quickly as possible. Rules as stated in the bylaws will ALWAYS override the result of the error.

 

Rosters: The league will be comprised of 12 teams. Active rosters will consist of a maximum of 40 players regardless of position throughout the season and up to 50 during the off season. By the cut down deadline your active roster must be trimmed to 40 players again.

Cut down: Prior to each year’s opening game, teams must cut their rosters back down to 40 players on their active roster. The cut down date will be determined and posted to the calendar each season prior to the first NFL regular season game.

Lineups: Starting lineups may not include bye week players. Active management of starting lineups is expected.  Lineups will not roll over week to week, neglected lineups will not be tolerated. Penalties for frequently neglected lineups could include loss of future rookie draft picks. Starting lineups will consist of the following:

Offense: 1-QB, 2-RB, 3-WR, 1-TE, 1-Flex(WR/TE/RB), 1-K = 9 Starters

Defense: 3 DL, 3-LB, 3-DB =9 Starters

Trades: Trading is allowed and encouraged. The trade deadline is kickoff of the first game for week 13 of the regular season and will resume the day after the league championship game. All trades are finalized by the commissioner. Teams must meet 40-player roster maximum requirement to trade. Trades which put teams above the 40-player maximum will not be processed. Future draft picks will be available for trade up to 2 years out. Draft picks may be traded away or traded for as each owner sees fit. Teams may enter the draft with as many as they can acquire, or as few as they choose. “Conditional” picks, player rental trades, or trades for items of real world value, or future considerations are not allowed. Teams who wish to trade future first round draft picks will be charged a non-refundable fee that goes towards the traded pick year’s dues depending on the pick traded. Future costs are as follows:

1st - $40
2nd - $25
3rd - $10
4th - $5
5th - $3

Adds/Drops/Waivers/Free Agency: Free agency will opperate as follows:

Off Season- This league will be utilizing a F.A.A.B. (Free Agency Acquisition Budget) system for waiver wire acquisitions during the league off-season. At the beginning of each off-season teams will be given a $100 budget to bid on free agents. Bidding windows will run weekly on Wednesdays at 10 am eastern time. The highest bidders for an individual player will be awarded the player at the closing of the bidding window and the bidding dollars will be removed from their budget.  Currency will not carry over year to year, but MAY be traded within the off season.

Season- We will run waiver requests for all locked free agents.  The order of waiver request will be based on (1) overall winning percentage, (2) total points sored, and (3) head-to-head record.  The order of waiver request will be applied in a “worst-to-first” manner, meaning that overall winning percentage will be the team in last place.  Free agents will be available on a first come first served basis after that. Dropped players will be locked for 2 days waiver period before becoming available for a team to acquire them.

Injured Reserve: Injured Reserve consists of unlimited spots for injured players only. A player is only eligible to be placed on IR if they are listed as such by the MFL. IR Players will not count against the 40-player roster.  Once a player is removed from IR by the MFL, the team manager MUST add that player to their active roster. Active rosters can NEVER EXCEED 40.

Official Scoring: Matchups will be a single ‘head to head” game each week. Note that all scores are final as of the start of the first game of the following week. The official source of stats for our league MFL, ESB.com and NFLGSIS.com (Elias Sports Bureau, THE OFFICIAL statistician on the NFL). Defensive stats are not always corrected so Commissioner has ability to check ESB for proper scoring and take corrective action with verifiable proof (game logs, video replay etc.). Owners are responsible for verifying the scores and the legality of their own lineups. Owners are responsible for notifying the commissioner of stat changes or possible mistakes should they occur. Scoring will be in a decimal format to help eliminate ties.

Ties: Ties will be counted as just that, a tie.

Playoff Format: 6 team playoff structure. Playoff bracket will consist of the top 6 teams with the best record.  Seeding tiebreakers will be in order: overall record, total regular season points scored, head to head results. Playoffs are weeks 15-17.  The 2 finalists face off in the Horseshoes and Handgrenades Fantasy Super Bowl. The playoff results will determine the rookie draft order of the playoff teams. The remaining non-playoff team’s rookie picks will be decided by the team’s Potential Points. The team with the lowest potential points in the regular season will receive rookie pick 1.01.  This is done to prevent tanking.

Rookie Draft: The rookie drafts will be 5 rounds of non-snaking NFL style drafts and consist of the incoming rookie class only. Veterans will not be eligible to be acquired through the draft process. Rookie draft order will be decided by the reverse order of standings from the prior season for the bottom 6 teams. The championship bracket playoff results for the top 6 will determine their rookie pick order. These drafts will take place by way of email draft with a 24 hour clock. Pick and player trading is allowed and encouraged during all drafts.

League Dues and Payouts: League dues will be $82 per team. All league and future draft pick trade fees will be paid to leaguesafe. $75 goes to the prize pool, and $6 covers MyFantasyLeague.com fees. League dues will be due before our rookie drafts. The payouts are as follows:

1st Place - $500

2nd Place - $250

3rd Place - $150 

League Expansion: If in the future we have new people wanting to join with no openings we will vote on it and need OVER 50% to pass.  If it passes, all teams will get 8 “untouchable” players and the new team gets to choose 1 player from each team to take onto their team.  If a player finishes the season on the NFL “IR” they are also “untouchable”.

 

Collusion and unsportsmanlike play will NOT BE TOLERATED! League integrity is of the utmost importance as this is a year to year league. The commissioner has the right to intervene under any questionable circumstances. You MUST remain an active team manager regardless of your win loss record. Your moves should be made with the intention of bettering your team for the present or future years while upholding league integrity. NO tanking allowed.   PLAY TO WIN!! Good luck!
